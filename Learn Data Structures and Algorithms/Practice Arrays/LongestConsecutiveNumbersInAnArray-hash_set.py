"""
You are given an array of integers.
The task is to find the length of the longest sequence
of consecutive integers that can be formed from the numbers
in the array.

The sequence does not need to follow the
original order in the array.
Duplicates should not break the sequence.

# 1. Insert all numbers into a set (to allow O(1) lookups).

# 2. Iterate through the set:

# 3. For each number, check if it is the start of a sequence (i.e., num - 1 is not in the set).
# If it is, keep extending the sequence (num + 1, num + 2, â€¦) until it breaks.
# Track the length of the sequence.
# Return the maximum length.

# The hash set approach is optimal (O(n)),
